Day 2 SQL


Whatever is there in projection other than aggregate functions needs to be there in group by..........

Internally Where clause executes before forming groups therefore we cannot use where clause for group by we have to use having..........

Group by clause is always executed after where clause or where is always executed before group by there where cannot be used for group by............

EX.  select job,sum(salary) from employees where job!='President' group by job having sum(salary)>30000 order by sum(salary) desc;
(Here first select will happen then group by will happen and then order by will happen.)

=======================================================================

select ename where ename like'S%';

select ename from employees where ename like'T__';

% - Any number of characters
_ - Any character but only one character

Can also be used for numbers and dates

select * from employees where doj like '%-01-%';

select * from employees where doj like '%2022%';


BETWEEN===============================

select * from employees where salary between 5000 and 20000;
// Here 5000 and 20000 are included


LIMIT==================================
select * from employees order by salary desc limit 3;

select * from employees order by doj desc limit 3;
select * from employees order by doj limit 1;

===============================================================
DUAL is temporary table
select current_date from dual;
select 1+2 from dual;


DATE FUNCTIONS==================================================

select current_date;
select year(current_date);

select ename,extract(month from doj) joining_month from employees;

select year(current_date);  yaer/month/date

select now();

select extract(hour from now());               //hour/week/year/year_month

select extract(year_month from current_date);  // hour_minute,hour_second,etc...

select extract(quarter from now());

DATE_FORMAT

select ename,date_format(doj,'%d-%m-%Y') from employees;  //every character has a specific value from %a,%A to %y,%Y


select ename,date_format(doj,'%a %D %b %Y') from employees;
